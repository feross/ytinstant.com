# [YouTube Instant](https://ytinstant.com) - Really fast YouTube search.

It started out as a bet with my roommate, Jake Becker. I bet him I could build real-time YouTube search in less than an hour. Sadly, I lost the bet – It took me 3 hours to finish it, and another couple hours to polish the user interface into what you see now at [YTInstant.com](http://ytinstant.com). But, I’m happy with the result.

It got 1 million visitors within 10 days of release, and the YouTube CEO, Chad Hurley, offered me a job over Twitter.

## About this repo

Posting this code here now, since I've recently been asked for the original code several times. Until now, the only YouTube Instant code that's been available is the minified version on the live website and the unfinished coffee-script port I started and put here on GitHub. So, here's the orignal code now. For you.

The code is pretty terrible, but that's part of the beauty of the whole thing. [None of Us Knows What We're Doing](http://feross.org/none-of-us-knows-what-were-doing/) and "Done is better than perfect" are totally true in this case. For a better representation of my programming ability, see my more recent repos.
